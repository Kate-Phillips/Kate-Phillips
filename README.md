- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kate-Phillips a Master's student at Tennessee Tech University 
- 👀 I’m interested in the cross between data science and mental health. 
    Specifically how data science can help improve or support college students' mental health.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my thesis project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Masters project using data science to do research in anxiety and depression that can lead into a PhD. 
- 📫 I can be reached at my student email: klphillips45@tntech.edu
